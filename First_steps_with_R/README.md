# First Steps With R

## Status: DRAFT

## What is R?

R is a free, open-source programming language that has very strong support for statistics.
It is used extensively in research and industry for areas such as data analysis, statistics, machine learning, bioinformatics, simulation, linguistics and much more.

With over [8000 freely available add-on packages](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/) that provide extensive additional functionality, R will probably have something that can help your research.

Don't just take our word for it though -- here's what others have to say

## Installing R and RStudio

Most users of R use it from within another free piece of software called RStudio.
RStudio is a powerful and productive user interface for R. Itâ€™s free and open source, and works great on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Our first task, therefore, is to install R and RStudio.

* Install R first. Downloads are available at https://cran.rstudio.com/
* Install RStudio second. Downloads are available at https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

## Starting RStudio

## Simple commands and calculations

R is a command based system which means that you (usually) interact with it by entering commands rather than using a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Some of these commands are rather straightforward! For example, R can be used to do arithmetic

    1+1
    3*9
    377/120

R can also do all of the mathematical operations that you'd expect to see on a scientific calculator. For example, to take the square root of two:

    sqrt(2)

This is the first time we've entered a **function** in R so let's discuss some details. In the above, the **function name** is `sqrt` and the **function argument** is 2. In R, all function arguments are enclosed in parentheses `()`

R is case sensitive. For example, the correct command for square root is `sqrt(2)` with everything in lower case. Variations such as `Sqrt(2)` or `SQRT(2)` won't work (**try it!**).

R can also evaluate all the standard trigonometric functions such as `sin`, `cos` and `tan`. These take their arguments in radians rather than degrees. As such, a right angle is  `pi/2` rather than 90.

    sin(pi/2)

Unlike many scientific calculators, R's `log` function takes the natural logarithm by default.

    log(10)

If you want to calculate a logarithm to base 10, you'll need to specify the base as a second argument.

    log(100,base=10)

This shows another feature of R functions -- **named arguments**. In this case, the named argument is **base**. Since the second argument to `log` is, by design, always the base you could have simply executed

    log(100,10)

but the named argument version is more readable.

## Variables

* Assignment
* ls()
* rm(list=ls())

## Packages

## Built in datasets

R comes with a package called **datasets** that contains a set of classic datasets such as [Fisher's Iris data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) and [Anscombe's quartet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet). This package is one of the few that are loaded when you start R.

To see the full list of available datasets, execute the command

    library(help="datasets")

We are going to focus on the iris dataset which is stored as an R object called a Data Frame in the variable name `iris`. Learn more about this dataset using the `help` command:

    help(iris)

If you run the above command, you'll see that R's documentation tells us that *"iris is a data frame with 150 cases (rows) and 5 variables (columns) named Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width, and Species."*

Let's confirm this information for ourselves by introducing a few more R commands. `dim()` tells us the dimensions of a data frame

    dim(iris)

The `names()` function tells us the column names of a data frame.

    names(iris)

We can extract any of the columns by name using the `$` operator. To get a list of the petal lengths for example we do

    iris$Petal.Length  

The `str()` function gives a compact summary of the structure of its input

    str(iris)

The `head()` function shows us the first 6 data points.

    head(iris)

You could display the entire data frame by simply entering

    iris

Alternatively, we can obtain some summary statistics about this data frame using the `summary()` command

    summary(iris)

## Plotting data

Let's extract the columns Petal.Length and Petal.Width and plot them against each other

    x = iris$Petal.Length
    y = iris$Petal.Width
    plot(x,y)

We add axis labels and titles by supplying named arguments to the plot command

    plot(x,y,xlab="Petal Length",ylab="Petal Width",main="Iris Data")

Each datapoint has an iris species associated with it - one of setosa, versicolor and virginica. We can see this by asking R what the structure of the `iris$Species` column is

    str(iris$Species)

Factors are how R represent [categorical variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_variable). We can see what the factor levels are with

    levels(iris$Species)

We can include this information on the plot by coloring each datapoint according to its species.

    plot(x,y,xlab="Petal Length",ylab="Petal Width",main="Iris Data",col=iris$Species)

 Finally, let's add a legend

    plot(x,y,xlab="Petal Length",ylab="Petal Width",main="Iris Data",col=iris$Species)
    legend(x = 1, y = 2.5, legend = levels(iris$Species), col = c(1:3), pch=1)

**TODO: ggplot2**

## Importing your own data

* read.csv

## The current working directory. Projects.

## Downloading data directly from the internet

## Scripts

In the simplest terms, a script is just a list of R commands that can be run in order with a single command.

EXAMPLE

An alternative way to think of a script is as a **permanent, repeatable, annotated, shareable, cross-platform archive**<sup>1</sup> of your analysis! Everything required to repeat your analysis is available in a single place. The only extra required ingredient is a computer.
