# Code Cafe at Coffee Revolution

Do you want to learn a little more about programming but never find the time?
Why not join us at the Code Cafe at Coffee Revolution? A group of research software engineers will be on hand to help you work through some programming exercises.

Drink coffee, learn some code, chat to other researchers, data scientists and programmers.

First session is on Wednesday 9th March at 17.30 where the subject will be **First Steps with R**

Attendance is free but places are limited so please book via our Eventbrite page.
